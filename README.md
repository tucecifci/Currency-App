## My process

### 💡 Built with

- React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Axios - HTTP client for API requests
- FreeCurrencyAPI - Real-time exchange rate API
- React Icons - Icon library

### 🧠 What I learned

While building this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the following concepts:

1. React State Management:
- Learned how to manage state with useState for dynamic user interactions.
- Used state to synchronize input values and dropdown selections with the UI.

2. Making API Requests:
- Implemented asynchronous API requests using axios to fetch real-time exchange rate data.
- Handled dynamic query parameters like base_currency and API keys.

3.React Forms and Events:
- Mastered how to handle user input with onChange and keep the state updated in real time.
- Learned how to structure and style forms effectively.

4.Component Structure:
- Organized components for reusability and readability.
- Applied CSS for styling to make the app user-friendly.

5.Error Handling:
- Learned how to handle API errors and fallback states (if applicable).

6.Styling with CSS:
- Applied custom styles for inputs, buttons, and layouts to enhance user experience. <br/>

This project helped me understand practical React concepts and strengthen my ability to build interactive applications.
